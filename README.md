# HighScoreProj
A project that allows a user to put their high score into a leader board these scores are then saved to a csv

Some things ive learned while working with this project:

1.user.dir/the getProperty command

2.that text areas are much better than text fields

3.moving data out of a csv and into an array

4. figured out how to import 3rd party libraries
